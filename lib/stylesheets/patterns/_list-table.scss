/*

List Table Technical Requirements:

1) Supports fluid-width layouts.
2) Supports fixed and fluid-width cells.
3) Does not require explicit cell widths to be set for every column.

Table Notes:

* Does not support scrolling within a table.
* Auto lays out cells.
* Can it support overlays?

Div Notes:

* No auto layout without using display: table.
* Does not support fixed and fluid-width cells.
* Using display: table most likely defeats other benefits of DIVs.
* Easily support overlays.
